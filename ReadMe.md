# The Dsafund Project
I am participating in the [SPRING 2023 CHAINLINK HACKATHON](https://chainlinkspring2023.devpost.com/) with my entry project. It revolves around **DSACORP**, a pioneering decentralized community management platform that offers comprehensive services for Web3.0 projects.
Our primary focus is to provide unwavering support, ensuring community members are actively involved, well-informed, and entertained. By doing so, we aim to drive greater adoption of blockchain technology and contribute to the overall success of various projects.
